_anitomy-js_ is a Node.js wrapper for [Anitomy](https://github.com/erengy/anitomy) - a C++ library for parsing anime video filenames.

## Requirements

+ Linux: gcc/g++ >= 5
+ Windows: Visual Studio >= 2015 (With C++ build tools)
+ Mac OS >= 10.9 (with Xcode installed, of course)

## Installation

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install anitomy-js
```

_anitomy-js_ builds it's dependencies upon installation. Please refer to the [node-gyp documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) if you're having problems with the build.

### Version 1.x

Starting with version 1.0 the minimum supported Node version is 0.12

### Changes from version 2.x

Starting with version 2.0, _anitomy-js_ requires C++ 14 and at least Node 4:

- Linux: GCC/G++ >= 5
- Windows: Visual Studio >= 2015
- Mac OS >= 10.9

If you can't update your build tools, all versions from 1.x are compatible with C++ 11.

### Changes from version 3.x

Starting with version 3.0 the old callback style with a single argument is deprecated. You should switch to either use the Promise API or a node style callback (err, data).
The minimum supported Node version is 6.

### Changes from version 4.x

4.x is a complete rewrite from scratch and requires at least Node 8. The old callback style API was completely removed and now the _async_ methods (parse and parseAsync) exposes only the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) API.

### Changes from version 5.x

On version 5.x, _anitomy-js_ switched from using [NAN](https://github.com/nodejs/nan), to the newer [NAPI](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api).
With this change, all context-related issues should be fixed.

## Usage

_anitomy-js_ provides two methods: `parse` and `parseSync`.
Both methods accept single filename input or an array of filenames for batch parsing.

Additionally you can pass an object as the last parameter to change Anitomy's original parsing options. The options are:

- `allowed_delimiters` - defaults to `" _.&+,|"`
- `ignored_strings` - defaults to `[]`
- `parse_episode_number` - defaults to `true`
- `parse_episode_title` - defaults to `true`
- `parse_file_extension` - defaults to `true`
- `parse_release_group` - defaults to `true`

### parse(data, [options]) -> Promise\<AnitomyResult | AnitomyResult[]>

```js
var anitomy = require('anitomy-js')
anitomy
  .parse('[tlacatlc6] Natsume Yuujinchou Shi Vol. 1v2 & Vol. 2 (BD 1280x720 x264 AAC)')
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
```

... would be parsed into

```json
{
  "anime_title": "Natsume Yuujinchou Shi",
  "audio_term": "AAC",
  "file_name": "[tlacatlc6] Natsume Yuujinchou Shi Vol. 1v2 & Vol. 2 (BD 1280x720 x264 AAC)",
  "release_group": "tlacatlc6",
  "release_version": "2",
  "source": "BD",
  "video_term": "x264",
  "video_resolution": "1280x720",
  "volume_number": ["1", "2"]
}
```

### parseSync(data, [options]) -> AnitomyResult | AnitomyResult[]

```js
var anitomy = require('anitomy-js')
var filenames = [
  '[DmonHiro] Magi - The Labyrinth Of Magic - Vol.1v2 (BD, 720p)',
  '[KLF]_D.Gray-man_04V2.avi',
]
console.log(anitomy.parseSync(filenames))
```

... would be parsed into

```json
[
  {
    "anime_title": "Magi - The Labyrinth Of Magic",
    "file_name": "[DmonHiro] Magi - The Labyrinth Of Magic - Vol.1v2 (BD, 720p)",
    "release_group": "DmonHiro",
    "release_version": "2",
    "source": "BD",
    "video_resolution": "720p",
    "volume_number": "1"
  },
  {
    "anime_title": "D.Gray-man",
    "episode_number": "04",
    "file_extension": "avi",
    "file_name": "[KLF]_D.Gray-man_04V2",
    "release_group": "KLF",
    "release_version": "2"
  }
]
```
